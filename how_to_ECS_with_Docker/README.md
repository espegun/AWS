# How to use ECR (with Docker)

## The purpose
The purpose of containers is a light-weight, isolated environment where all dependencies can be declared. It enables simpler recreation of environments and results. Docker is the de-facto container standard and is well-suited to be deployed in AWS' ECS, Elastic Container Service. Like for Lambdas, ECS abstracts away actual servers and makes scaling ar easier.



## How does it work?
- A *Dockerfile* specifies the dependencies for the container.
- A *Docker Image* is the result of *building* the Dockerfile, which has all the libraries, setups and code needed to run an application.
- A *Docker Container* is the *instantiation* of the Docker Image.
